# This is the tribesoundradio source code

Established in 2018, tribesoundradio was an idea that manifested into an online radio show two years later. Originally, it was just a 60-minute music mix that consisted of 'undiscovered' music, hosted by the founder, sethu. Now, tribesoundradio has plans of developing into an online audio-visual radio experience â€” redefining what radio is. While maintaining the concept of bringing you the best up-and-coming talent, we will bring you even more content, more shows, and more art. From South Africa to the world!
